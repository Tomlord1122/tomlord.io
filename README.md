# tomlord.fyi

This is the second time I'm building my personal website.

For this website, I followed the SvelteKit development guide to implement some key features and learn concepts:

1. Routing mechanism
2. Practicing \$effect, \$state, \$derived runes
3. Familiarizing myself with Tailwind CSS
4. Familiarizing myself with SVX (markdown package in SvelteKit)

You can check out the repository to see how Svelte code is written.
